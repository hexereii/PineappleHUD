# HexHUD

HOW TO DOWNLOAD;

Download the 'zip' folder from Github, and extract it anywhere easily accessible for you.
Cut the "BerryHud" folder from this extract
Paste it into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom"
**Optional, but I highly recommend putting vgui_cache_res_files 0 in your autoexec so that the buttons all work properly!!**
Enjoy the HUD!!
